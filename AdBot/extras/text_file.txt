    Marketing:

        - Advertise the fact that whenever a server pings @everyone, those people will usually go to #general and the other channels that the ads will be on. Hence, they will get the benefits of an @everyone ping basically for free every time the server uses it.
        - Compare traditional Discord Ads with Squanchy Ads. Use pictures and Graphs with expert imagery.
